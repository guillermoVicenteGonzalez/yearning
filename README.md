## Project description
This is a little game i made to test my (little) skills at game dev with unity,
Almost every asset of the game was made by me except for two or three sprites and all the sound effects. That explains the lack of quality of the product.
The work is sloppy and some systems could definitely use some work but it is a finished product and i kinda feel proud of it.
